      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to think of a fun project to help me expand my programming skills. The other day I was practicing piano and I realized a large barrier I face when trying to practice is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to know exactly what I should be practicing. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a piano teacher so I have to make up a practice regemin for myself. So of course I go online to see what I should practice and am bombarded with information.</description>
