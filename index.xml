      <description>Based on the spec laid out in my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m creating as simple of a golang app as possible to satisfy everything.
First and foremost I am trying to make a working product, so I&amp;rsquo;m resisting an urge to optimize and make everything DRY. Of course if I notice I&amp;rsquo;m reusing a ton of the same code I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap it in a function to make things readable.
Representing each exercise I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a little struct to represent exercises.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to think of a fun project to help me expand my programming skills. The other day I was practicing piano and I realized a large barrier I face when trying to practice is that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to know exactly what I should be practicing. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a piano teacher so I have to make up a practice regemin for myself. So of course I go online to see what I should practice and am bombarded with information.</description>
